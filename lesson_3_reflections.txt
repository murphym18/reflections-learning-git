When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I am working with others. A remote repo on a server can act as a hub for
collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This gives me the opportunity to pull changes from many different places and
merges them. The merging effort may require multiple commits and it makes sense
for me to manually pull from each place when I'm ready. Also when working with
others this is important.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on github. clones are copies of the repo. Branches are an
organizational tool for keeping track of different histories with a repo.

I should use a fork to make my own changes to a project I find on github.

I would use clone anytime I want to copy a repo from one place to another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It lets me explore the remote state quickly with using the network. It makes it
possible for me to push fast forward merges to a remote server.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Many things would be harder, probably everything. I would use some other version
control system and a server. But without any manually version control, I would
probably use a central server with separate directories for every person to keep
their version of the project.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
